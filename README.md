## About

This project utilizes [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) to automate web browsers. It is designed to help developers and testers perform automated testing, data extraction, and repetitive browser tasks efficiently.

## Features

- Automated browser control (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
- Functional and end-to-end testing
- Web scraping capabilities
- Page element interaction and data extraction
- Configurable test cases and scripts
- Logging and error handling

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Azmaininqiad/Selenium.git
   cd Selenium
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   Make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed. Then, install the required packages:

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   > _Note: The project may require browser drivers (e.g., ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver). Download the appropriate driver and add it to your system PATH._

## Usage

1. **Configure your test or automation script:**
   - Edit or create Python scripts as needed, specifying the target URLs and test logic.

2. **Run a Selenium script:**
   ```sh
   python your_script.py
   ```

3. **Example:**
   ```python
   from selenium import webdriver

   driver = webdriver.Chrome()

   print(driver.title)
   driver.quit()
   ```
