# Selenium

A Python project for web browser automation using Selenium.

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to automating browser interactions using the Selenium framework in Python. Selenium is widely used for browser-based automation tasks such as testing, scraping, and repetitive task execution.

## Features

- 100% Python-based, leveraging the Selenium WebDriver API.
- Supports browser automation for testing, data extraction, and workflow automation.
- Customizable scripts for various web automation scenarios.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python (recommended: latest stable version)
- pip (Python package installer)
- Selenium Python package
- Browser driver (e.g., ChromeDriver for Google Chrome, GeckoDriver for Firefox)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Azmaininqiad/Selenium.git
   cd Selenium
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *(If `requirements.txt` is missing, install Selenium manually: `pip install selenium`)*

3. **Set up the appropriate browser driver:**
   - Download the browser driver for your preferred browser (e.g., ChromeDriver for Chrome).
   - Add the driver executable to your system PATH.

### Running Scripts

- Place your Selenium Python scripts in the project directory.
- Run scripts using:
  ```sh
  python your_script.py
  ```

## Example Usage

```python
from selenium import webdriver

driver = webdriver.Chrome()
driver.get("https://www.example.com")
print(driver.title)
driver.quit()
```

## Repository Structure

- All scripts and modules should be placed in the root or organized into subdirectories as needed.
- Ensure you have the necessary driver binaries available.

> **Note:** This documentation is based on the available repository metadata and standard Selenium usage patterns. For the latest or more scripts, please refer to the [GitHub code search results](https://github.com/Azmaininqiad/Selenium/search).
